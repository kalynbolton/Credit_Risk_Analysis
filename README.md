# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
We are tasked with applying machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. We were to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We used models with resampling. At the end we evaluate the performace of our models and decide whether or not they should be used to assess credit card risk.

## Results
The balanced accuracy scores ranged anywhere from 0.35 to 0.99. Each machine learning model output very similar results as seen in the data file. The conufsion matrix seemed to be similar as well.

# Summary
Due to each model providing almost the exact same results, I would suggest any of them to use to assess credit risk.
